# multi_future_chance_constraints

Requirements for toy implementations: 

1. Casadi (use pip for installation)
2. If generating an .mp4 video, install ffmpeg. Otherwise PIL can be used to generate a .gif file. See last few lines of code for visualization.
3. Green car is ego, red cars are other vehicles. N is the number of vehicles, M is the number of futures. Change reference paths using the variables 'pi_ref'.
